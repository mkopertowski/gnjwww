<h1>
	Expedition Bihor, winter 2001
</h1>

<p>In February 2001 Caver's Club SG Wrocław organized a cave diving expedition to Valea Gîrda Seaca in Bihor Mountains (Romania). Five cave divers took part in this event: Wiktor Bolek - leader, Maciej Czykierda, Rafał Garski, Rafał Górecki and Norbert Ziober. Despite it was a mid-winter time there was no snow in the mountains, temperatures during the day were positive, the water flow in the streams was quite high. However it was possible to dive in biggest resurgences in the valley: Cotetul Dobrestilor and Izbucul de la Tauz. Moreover, Izbucul de la Tauz was accessible by a car.</p>

<p>Most cave dives were made in Tauz. This resurgence was explored by Czech's divers in 1988. The first sump is 40m long and 13m deep. In the second sump they reached the depth -70m reporting narowances between -60m and -70m. It occurred that there was no guide line in the sump left by our predecesors. The visibility was restricted to 0,5 m. The current was not an important factor during the dives. Two our first dives were made in order to rig the known part of the sumps. The depth of -35m was reached in the second sump. Next dive was made using trimix. The depth -72m was reached. Up till that point no restrictions were encountered. At the depth of -50m the corridor was low on both sides, but in the middle it was comfortably high. If one gets to close to the wall in a low visibility, it may give an impression of a narrow area. Belaying the guide line in the middle of corridor was the main difficulty. The bottom was covered with thick lawyer of gravel (grit). There was no natural points for anchors. The only possibility was to leave lead weights. But on the slope the weights drifted  slowly downwards and the line was tightened and pulled into a low zone.</p>

<p>During these days there was a frost during the nights and the current became smaller and visibility had impreved. On the intermediate dives on air Maciej Czykierda and Rafał Garski reached -60m and Rafał Górecki -66m.</p>

<p>The final push was planned with a stronger trimix and oxygen decompression. At the depth of -75m the corridor became low on the whole cross-section. A hump sticked out from the ceiling. But there was enough space to swim through. Due to the trimix my mind was clear and could cope with this problem. I turned fins down and got slowly through the restriction. I managed to pass on the left side of corridor . A few meters lower the ceiling was low again at the left side. But the corridor opened to the right over a grit dune at the bottom. The guide line was not belayed properly and I had time only to left one weight. At the depth of 79.4m I turned back. I surfaced after an hour long decompresion. It was a deepest cave dive in Romania.</p>
