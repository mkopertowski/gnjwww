<h1>
	Polish version of side-mount
</h1>

<p>This type of bottle mounting is dedicated to narrow and short sumps. The main point in this configuration is to provide an easy way of attaching and detaching the bottle. The standard jacket with harness will not be used, because the area to be penetrated is constricted. A special belts are to be used. The bottle is attached at two points: at waist belt and at the strip on the chest.</p>
<p>A D-ring of stainless steel is inserted on the waist belt. It is stabilised by a clamp of stainless steel as well. One can change easily the position of the D-ring [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_1.jpg" target="_new">picture 1</a> ]. The link between bottle and the waist belt should be elastic. A rubber rope (5 mm diameter) is used for this purpose. A loop is tied on this line with the length adjusted to the diameter of the bottle [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_2.jpg" target="_new">picture 2</a> ]. A ratline knot is tied on this loop [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_3.jpg" target="_new">picture 3</a> ], and put on the bottle. In order to prevent the ratline knot to move on bottle an additional rubber (cut from inner car tyre) is put on [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_4.jpg" target="_new">picture 4</a> ]. The stitch, which comes out of the ratline knot is fastened by a plastic single-use strip. An alpinistic carabiner of a smooth lock is clipped in the stitch.</p>

<p>A loop of a nylon strip is put on the chest [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_5.jpg" target="_new">picture 5</a> ]. The arms are put through the loops and the carabiner is clipped at the breastbone. A ratline knot on the loop of standard nylon line (diameter 3-4 mm) is put on the bottle's neck [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_6.jpg" target="_new">picture 6</a> ]. This clipped by the next carabiner to the loop on the chest. This is the second point of bottle attachment.</p>
<p>This configuration allows for catching with one hand the stitch with carabiner. The carabiner lock can be opened by a single finger [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_7.jpg" target="_new">picture 7</a> ] and clipped to the D-ring on the waist belt. When the elastic, rubber line is used instead of standard nylon one, then it is much easier to attach the carabiner to the D-ring. While underwater, the mask restricts the visibility space and this clipping is done by touch. Moreover accumulator could be mounted on the waist belt, which make the job more difficult. The elastic rubber makes it easier.</p>
<p>The rubber is stretched on the surface, but underwater the bottle weight is diminished, and the rubber shrinks, and the bottle is shaped up well along the body.</p>
<p>The bottle is attached to the divers body in a loose manner. It makes it easier to negotiate in constricted passages [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_8.jpg" target="_new">picture 8</a> ]. It is possible to detach the bottles from the waist belt and push them ahead, while they are still clipped to the chest loop [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_9.jpg" target="_new">picture 9</a> ].</p>

<p>If both hands can be used for clipping the bottle, then stitch with carabiner at the bottles neck is hold by a one hand, while one finger opens the lock [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_10.jpg" target="_new">picture 10</a> ]. The stitch with carabiner at the other side of the bottle are hold in the same way [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_11.jpg" target="_new">picture 11</a> ]. The bottle is hold by the diver in the firm manner [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_12.jpg" target="_new">picture 12</a> ] and in the one move the bottle is clipped at two points [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_13.jpg" target="_new">picture 13</a> ].</p>

<p>If only one hand is used for clipping, then the bottle is clipped to the chest first and then to the waist. The advantage of this configuration is that the one hand is used for clipping one point. There is no need for simultaneous use of the second hand for holding the bottle.</p>

<p>The regulator with manometer is screwed to the valve [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_14.jpg" target="_new">picture 14</a> ]. The manometer hose is shaped up well under the rubbers on the bottle. The gauge is at the height of the valve and should be easily seen by the diver. When the bottle is not used, then the hose from the second stage can be also put under the rubbers on the bottle. This hose is put out, when needed, by a single move. The second stage is clipped in a standard way to the rubber line at the diver's neck [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_15.jpg" target="_new">picture 15</a> ].</p>
<p>In order to avoid opening and closing the valve (of a bottle ready to use) a FCD (Freeflow Control Device) joint is used [ <a class="navi" href="../szkolenie/img/sidemount_16.jpg" target="_new">picture 16</a> ]. Because the valves are under the diver's arms it is not necessary to use special valve protectors.</p>
